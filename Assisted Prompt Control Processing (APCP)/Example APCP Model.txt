Assisted Prompt Control Processing (APCP) Model

1. **User Input Stage**

   - The user formulates a prompt or query.
   - The system provides guidelines for structured input.

2. **Approval Checkpoint 1: Initial Review**

   - The user reviews the prompt for accuracy and relevance.
   - Manual approval is required before proceeding.

3. **AI Processing Stage**

   - The approved prompt is sent to the AI model.
   - The AI generates a preliminary response.

4. **Approval Checkpoint 2: AI Output Review**

   - The user reviews the AI-generated response.
   - If modifications are needed, the user refines the prompt and reprocesses.

5. **Finalization Stage**

   - Once the user is satisfied with the response, they approve the final output.
   - The response is saved, shared, or utilized as needed.

6. **Audit & Logging**

   - All prompts, approvals, and responses are logged for traceability.
   - A review mechanism ensures compliance and security.

This APCP model ensures human oversight at every stage of AI interaction, preventing unintended outputs and maintaining control over critical decisions.
