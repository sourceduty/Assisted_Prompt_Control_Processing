The APCP Knowledge Generator v1.0 depicted in the image is a locally executed program designed to facilitate scientific inquiry by generating AI-driven prompts based on user-selected research fields. The interface mimics a command-line terminal, offering a structured menu with four main options: selecting a scientific field, refining previous discoveries, viewing scientific response logs, and exiting the application. When a user selects the first option, the program lists twelve fields spanning physical sciences, life sciences, and emerging technologies. Once a field is selected — in this case, “Physics” — the generator produces a detailed and structured prompt that guides the AI to explore unsolved scientific problems, specifically considering theoretical challenges, technological barriers, and experimental limitations. This targeted prompt formulation ensures that the AI response remains focused and contextually rich, supporting researchers in identifying critical knowledge gaps.

The APCP process is explicitly embedded in the prompt submission phase. Before the AI processes the query, users are required to manually copy and paste the generated prompt, with an option to edit, ensuring deliberate human oversight. This mechanism reflects the core principle of APCP — preventing unintended AI outputs by mandating human approval at every interaction stage. The model used for processing the query is locally specified as "Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO," indicating a tailored, offline language model setup. This localized and manual method increases security and user control, making it particularly well-suited for academic or high-stakes environments where autonomous AI behavior is undesirable. Overall, the design exemplifies a disciplined application of AI where creativity, critical thinking, and human validation intersect to drive meaningful scientific inquiry.
