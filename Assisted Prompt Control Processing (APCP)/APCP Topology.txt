Final Output Generation (Approved AI Response)

### Explanation:

1. **User Oversight**: The process begins with human control over AI interactions.
2. **Approval Mechanism**: Prompts must be manually reviewed before execution.
3. **Prompt Processing Unit**: AI refines the input query within a controlled scope.
4. **AI Model Interaction**: The AI processes the query within predefined guardrails.
5. **Response Verification**: The output is checked again before being sent to the user.
6. **Final Output Generation**: The approved response is displayed to the user.

This structure ensures controlled AI interactions, reducing unintended outputs.
